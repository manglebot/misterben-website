		<h1>Francis Bacon interactive</h1>

        <h3>My most successful piece of work done for Tate</h3>

        <p>Interactive room guide created for a large Francis Bacon exhibition at Tate Britain.</p>
            
        <p>Created in Flash, containing audio, video, photographs and text, it took just 6 weeks.</p>

        <p>I worked with a small team, including a researcher and exhibition coordinator, but the design and implementation were left up to me.</p>
        
        <p>I had previously been learning Actionscript, but only knew basic animation, and realised pretty quickly that I needed to learn a huge amount to get up to speed if I was to fulfill my concept of an interface where users could travel around a large area in any direction they wanted, to be able to click on links and fly across a the canvas to another area (or room), and that let users zoom in and out and explore the work and life of Francis Bacon in an almost open world game like freedom.</p>

        <p>Thankfully I discovered GSAP animation library, which made  animating so much simpler. Since then this library has been transposed to Javascript, so the skills I learnt then are still useful.</p>

        <p>I also had to learn how to include both audio clips and videos, all with custom interfaces.</p>

        <p>Overall, it was a very successful piece of work that complemented the exhibition at Tate Britain, and even got great reviews online as a stand alone interactive.</p>
