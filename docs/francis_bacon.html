		<h1>Francis Bacon interactive</h1>
		
			<p>The most successful piece of work I did for the Tate was an interactive room guide created for a large Francis Bacon exhibition at Tate Britain. Created in Flash, containing audio, video, photographs and text, it took just 6 weeks. I basically had to learn how to program enough Actionscript in that time to allow me to fulfill my concept of  an interface where users could travel around a large area in any direction they wanted, to be able to click on links and fly across a the canvas to another area (or room), and that let users zoom in and out and explore the work and life of Francis Bacon in an almost open world game like freedom.</p>
