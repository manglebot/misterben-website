            </h3>

            <h3>Random Highlights</h3>

            <p class="spacer-after">
                <ul>
                    <li><b>1998</b> Introducing CSS to Arcadia Group websites. Along with being my first proper website job, I got to add bits of javascript (eg fill in the blanks quiz), and slowly evolve the site as my skills improved.</li>
                    <li><b>2000 (ish)</b> Senior front end developer for Currys / The Link websites. I worked as a freelancer for 2 years for Syzygy agency, and this was a highlight.</li>
                    <li><b>2005-2010</b> Buidling custom websites for Tate Gallery, though ususally following a theme, we evolved the way the exhibitions where presented and had freedom to explore new ways of loading content, particularly large images for exhibition room guides</li>
                    <li><b>2009</b> I designed and built a large Flash interactive for a major Francis Bacon exhibition, which meant learning a fair amount of Actionscript in a very short space of time, while given more or less complete freedom to go about the project any way I saw fit. This was a mixture of the hardest I worked at that job, along with the most fun. The final site got entered into several large competitions, but alas got beaten by MOMA (who most likely with a much larger budget, and large team, created a stunning interactive). The skills I learnt here were also used for another Flash interactive for Tate's Archive department, and then later for a cool movie website that you flew through space from link to link - though the movie never got made. However, the Actionscript library I discovered that allowed me to create all this is called GSAP, and was ported to Javascript, so is still relevant today. This site you're reading uses it. </li>
                    <li><b>2013</b> Award winning NHS training website. I was brought on as a short term freelancer but stayed over 7 months (until they merged company and got rid of all freelancers). I had a lovely team to work with and helped create code that worked across numerous platforms.</li>
                    <li><b>2018</b> Learned how to code websites with Wordpress and built and customised a site for a small coffee company. I haven't learnt PHP, but understood enough to make tweaks to templates, and then mostly add CSS styling for changes</li>
                    <li><b>2020</b> I built another Wordpress site for the same company, but this time got my head around WooCommerce, and created a Christmas site.</li>
                    <li><b>2023</b> Again for the same company I took their WooCommerce site and rebuilt it into a complete website.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>

            <h3>Career Break</h3>
            
            <p>The gap above is due to a career break to look after children. I am currently retraining using primarily Scrimba website. They have an excellent interactive training course, so I'm trying to get back to speed as fast as possible.</p>

            <h3>Current Developer Skills</h3>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li><b>HTML5</b> Fairly solid</li>
                    <li><b>CSS3</b> Excellent grounding, but still learning many new tricks.</li>
                    <li><b>Javascript</b> Reasonable grasp, but still re-learning from scratch as I feel this will help me better understand React, which I'm also learning. ES6 didn't exist when I stopped, so learning that too.</li>
                    <li><b>Javascript libraries</b> GSAP, JQuery, a few others.</li>
                    <li><b>Github</b> Use all the time.</li>
                    <li><b>Wordpress</b> I can set up a site easily, add themes and customise to clients content.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
