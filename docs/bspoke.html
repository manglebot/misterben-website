		<h1>B'spoke Coffee</h1>
		
			<p>I've created 3 websites for B'spoke Coffee House. The first was taking an existing wordpress template and evolving it to fit the required needs of the company at that time. The second was a mini site ecommerce site created with WooCommerce for a xmas special. This laid way to a new ecommerce site that evolves into a full website that has both the ecommerce and blogging side. I got to incorporate work from a local artist, which I animated with GSAP scrolltrigger so a bicyle flies across the screen as you scroll down.</p>
