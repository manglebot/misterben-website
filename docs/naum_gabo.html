            <h3>Naum Gabo interactive for Tate Archive</h3>
		
			<p>Following on from the Francis Bacon interactive success, I was invited by Tate Archive to create an interactive for the life and work of Naum Gabo. Again created in Flash, but this time using a database for the very large amount of content. I created a layout that allowed you to choose by subject or date or other category or everything and a wall of thumbnails would appear that you could click on to find more information. A sort of slide show on steriods.</p>

            <p>I worked again with a small team including a researcher, curator and another developer who showed me how to turn Excel spreadsheets into XML for the Flash to read. At one point, I learnt enough Actionscript to enable the content to load much faster.</p>
