		<h1>Tate Exhibitions</h1>
		
		<p>I had the pleasure of working for the Tate Gallery for 4 1/2 years, primarily looking after Tate Modern. One of the tasks was to create a custom website for every exhibition. Usually following on from the print designs (website always came last!), I would create a design that complemented the print designs along with creating room guides that allowed people to get a sneak preview or for people that couldn't get to the exhibition a chance to see what was on show.</p>
		
		<p>Examples shown here include the Duchamp, Man Ray Picabia exhibition where I managed to use the urinal holes as bullet points. Doris Salcedo print artwork came in at an angle, so I created a website where nearly everything was slightly wonky. Street &amp; Studio was a fairly minimal design with a  simple blue strip that I carried through each page.</p>
