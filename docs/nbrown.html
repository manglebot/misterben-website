		<h1>N Brown Group fashion websites</h1>
		
			<p>I got to work for NBrown websites on a couple occasions including work as a UI designer, but the most fun I had their was the day to day fashion website designs, working to very tight deadlines often with numerous projects needing to be completed every day. I got to create layouts with photos and text, along with coding the pages and loved the fast pace of this role.</p>
